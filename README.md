# Cockpit

![Cockpit Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot1.avif)

Cockpit is a desktop app for working with GitHub Copilot CLI from a native GUI instead of the terminal. It wraps Copilot chat, project context, and basic git workflows in a macOS-first Electron app built with Vue 3 and TypeScript.

The app lets you add local repositories, create and reopen chat threads, send prompts to Copilot, review streamed responses, handle tool permission requests, and keep thread history saved between launches. It also shows repository status for the active project so you can review changed files and run a simple commit and push flow from the same interface.

## Features

- **Native Desktop Experience**: macOS-first Electron app with a clean, intuitive interface
- **Project Management**: Add and manage local Git repositories
- **Chat Threads**: Create, save, and reopen conversation threads with preserved context
- **Copilot Integration**: Full integration with GitHub Copilot CLI via ACP (Agent Client Protocol)
- **Model Selection**: Per-thread model selection with dynamic discovery from Copilot CLI
- **Git Workflow**: View repository status, review changed files, and commit/push from the app
- **Permission Management**: Approve or deny Copilot tool/trust requests from the GUI
- **Persistence**: All projects, threads, and settings saved between app launches

## Requirements

- **macOS** (primary platform) or **Linux** (x64 / arm64)
- **Node.js** 22 LTS or later
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** installed and authenticated
- **Git** for repository management

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js 22 LTS or later
2. Install GitHub Copilot CLI:
   ```bash
   # Install via npm
   npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
   
   # Authenticate with GitHub
   copilot auth login
   ```

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bcarrillodev/cockpit-app.git
   cd cockpit-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Package as a macOS distributable (`.dmg` + `.zip`):
   ```bash
   # Add your app icon first — see build/README.md
   npm run package:mac
   # Output appears in dist/
   ```

6. Package as a Linux distributable (`.AppImage` + `.deb`):
   ```bash
   # Add build/icon.png first — see build/README.md
   npm run package:linux
   # Output appears in dist/
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch Cockpit** - Start the app and it will detect your Copilot CLI installation
2. **Add Projects** - Click "Add Project" to select local Git repositories
3. **Create Threads** - Select a project and create a new chat thread
4. **Chat with Copilot** - Send prompts and receive streaming responses
5. **Manage Models** - Switch between available Copilot models per thread
6. **Git Operations** - Review changed files and commit/push directly from the app
